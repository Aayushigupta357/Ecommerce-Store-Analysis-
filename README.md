## Description
This repository contains a Power Bi dashboard of an E-commerce store to answer questions about the data. The insights of the dashboard can be found in the results.txt file. This repository can be used as a starting point for anyone who wants to learn how to use Power Bi to analyze data.

## Objective

   - Tracking total sales amount, quantity sold, and profit.

  - Identifying regional performance (by state).

   - Understanding customer purchase behavior.

  - Monitoring sales distribution by product categories and sub-categories.

 - Analyzing payment mode preferences.

- Highlighting monthly profit trends.

## Conclusion

* Strengths: Clothing is the largest contributor to sales; Maharashtra is the strongest market; printers and bookcases are the most profitable sub-categories.

* Weaknesses: Over-reliance on COD payments, inconsistent monthly profits, and underperformance in Delhi and some sub-categories.

* Opportunities: Boost online/digital payment adoption, expand presence in weaker states, and improve profitability of low-performing categories (like tables).

## Recommendations

+ Focus on expanding high-profit sub-categories.

+ Diversify the customer base to reduce dependence on few buyers.

+ Encourage digital payment adoption with incentives.

+ Implement seasonal sales strategies to manage profit fluctuations.

+ Optimize marketing and distribution in weaker states (Delhi, etc.).
